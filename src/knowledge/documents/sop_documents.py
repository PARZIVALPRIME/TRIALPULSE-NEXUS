- Used for AEs, medical history, indications
- Version controlled per study
- Hierarchy: SOC > HLGT > HLT > PT > LLT

2.2 Dictionary Version
- Specified in Data Management Plan
- Version locked during study
- Upgrades per defined process

3. CODING PROCEDURES

3.1 Verbatim Term Review
a) Review verbatim term from CRF
b) Assess completeness and clarity
c) Query site if unclear
d) Document clarification

3.2 Coding Assignment
a) Search dictionary for matching term
b) Select most specific appropriate term
c) Code to LLT/PT level
d) Verify SOC assignment
e) Document coding decision

3.3 Coding Guidelines
- Code to reported term, not diagnosis
- Use most specific term available
- Avoid assumptions
- Query if uncertain
- Document rationale

4. CODING LEVELS

4.1 Preferred Term (PT)
- Primary coding level for analysis
- Represents single medical concept
- Used in safety tables

4.2 Lowest Level Term (LLT)
- Most granular level
- Linked to one PT
- Used for verbatim matching

4.3 System Organ Class (SOC)
- Highest grouping level
- Used for reporting
- Primary SOC assigned

5. AUTO-CODING
- System suggests codes for common terms
- Coder verifies suggestions
- Acceptance or override documented
- High-confidence threshold defined

6. QUALITY CONTROL
- Daily review of coded terms
- Batch review before lock
- Consistency checks
- Inter-coder reliability

7. DOCUMENTATION
- Coding conventions document
- Decision log
- Query documentation
- Version history

1. PURPOSE
This SOP describes the procedures for coding concomitant medications and prior therapies using the WHODrug dictionary.

2. CODING DICTIONARY

2.1 WHODrug Global
- Used for medications
- Version controlled per study
- Contains drug names, ingredients, ATC codes

2.2 Dictionary Version
- Specified in Data Management Plan
- Version locked during study
- Updates per defined process

3. CODING PROCEDURES

3.1 Drug Name Review
a) Review drug name from CRF
b) Assess completeness (name, formulation, route)
c) Query site if incomplete
d) Consider regional variations

3.2 Coding Assignment
a) Search dictionary for drug name
b) Match on trade name or generic
c) Verify formulation match
d) Assign ATC code
e) Document coding

3.3 Coding Guidelines
- Match trade name when available
- Use generic for combination products
- Consider regional brand names
- Query for clarification if needed

4. CODING LEVELS

4.1 Drug Record
- Drug name
- Formulation
- Route of administration
- Manufacturer (if needed)

4.2 ATC Classification
- Anatomical main group
- Therapeutic subgroup
- Pharmacological subgroup
- Chemical subgroup
- Chemical substance

5. HANDLING SPECIAL CASES

5.1 Combination Products
- Code to appropriate combination record
- Or code individual ingredients

5.2 Herbal/OTC Products
- Use WHODrug when available
- Document if not in dictionary

5.3 Investigational Drugs
- Do not code study drug
- Code other investigational per plan

6. QUALITY CONTROL
- Daily coding review
- Batch review before lock
- ATC code verification
- Inter-coder reliability checks
